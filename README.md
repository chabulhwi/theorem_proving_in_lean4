Theorem Proving in Lean 4
-----------------------

This is my fork of ["Theorem Proving in Lean 4"][tpil] by [Jeremy Avigad][ja], [Leonardo de
Moura][ldm], [Soonho Kong][sk] and [Sebastian Ullrich][su], with contributions from the [Lean
Community][lean-comm].

Note that *none* of the changes I made only to my fork was endorsed by the original authors.

+Be aware that some tactics in Lean's core library use classical

 Computationally, the purest part of dependent type theory avoids the
 use of ``Prop`` entirely. Inductive types and dependent function types

This manual is generated by [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). We are currently using a
[fork](https://github.com/leanprover/mdBook) of it for the following additional features:

* Add support for hiding lines in other languages [#1339](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1339)
* Replace calling `rustdoc --test` from `mdbook test` with `./test`

To build this manual, first install the fork via
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/leanprover/mdBook mdbook
```
Then use e.g. [`mdbook watch`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/cli/watch.html) in the root folder:
```bash
mdbook watch --open  # opens the output in `out/` in your default browser
```

Run `mdbook test` to test all `lean` code blocks.

## How to deploy

```
./deploy.sh
