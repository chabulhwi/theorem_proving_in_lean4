This note may help constructivists thinking of using Lean to save time.

### [c0028094](https://git.sr.ht/~chabulhwi/theorem_proving_in_lean4/commit/c002809407f9e82870a72d18886ec36dbffc893c) — [Bulhwi Cha](https://git.sr.ht/~chabulhwi/)

doc: clarify how Lean supports constructive logic

The paragraph I added explains how Lean core [supports constructive
logic][classical-tactics], whether the Lean core team will provide
tactics for constructive logic or [accept them from
contributors][not-priority], and whether a user can [develop them by
oneself][not-stopping] [outside the core][possible].

doc: remove phrases that took a critical tone

> …, regardless of how simple the change may be.

Jireh Loreaux said that the above phrasing ["seemed unnecessarily
antagonistic."][0] I'd say it sounded 'highly critical' of the Lean core
team but was also [pretty accurate][1].

Nevertheless, Siddhartha Gadgil and others in the Lean community seemed
to [agree with Jireh Loreaux][2]. So I decided to remove it and the word
"any" in the part "nor do they accept any changes that…"

This manual is generated by [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). We are currently using a
[fork](https://github.com/leanprover/mdBook) of it for the following additional features:

* Add support for hiding lines in other languages [#1339](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1339)
* Replace calling `rustdoc --test` from `mdbook test` with `./test`

To build this manual, first install the fork via
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/leanprover/mdBook mdbook
```
Then use e.g. [`mdbook watch`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/cli/watch.html) in the root folder:
```bash
mdbook watch --open  # opens the output in `out/` in your default browser
```

Run `mdbook test` to test all `lean` code blocks.

## How to deploy

```
./deploy.sh
```
